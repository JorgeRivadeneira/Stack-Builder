This project is structured in the next way:
- Data, this folder simulates the Data with 2 simple classes in C#, the DaysApply returns all
  the days with restrictions and with the restrict numbers of the plate.
  The HoursApply class returns all the hours that including the restrictions.
- Models, this folder has all the structured classes to handle the methods in the solution
- Services, this folder has a unique class to make all the calculations and validations

The Program Class contains the Main Method to call the calculation class and make all the 
validations.

Additionally I have implemented the UnitTestings project with all the UnitTest for each method
of the Calculation class.
